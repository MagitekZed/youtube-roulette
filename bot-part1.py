        Welcome to YouTube Roulette! Here's a detailed explanation of the rules:

        1Ô∏è‚É£ Each player's turn, they will randomly generate a 4-character search term using the 'Generate Term' button.
        2Ô∏è‚É£ The player will then search YouTube using this term and choose one of the first three videos that appear. Note that channels, playlists, and songs without a timestamp are considered wildcards and don't count as one of the three choices, though they may be chosen. If a playlist is chosen, you must play the FIRST video.
        3Ô∏è‚É£ The group must watch at least one full minute of the video (unless it is under one minute, in which case they must watch the whole video). After that time, players may begin "thumbs downing" a video by holding up their hand, and once a majority of players have thumbs downed, the game leader will exit the video.
        4Ô∏è‚É£ After everyone has taken a turn and chosen a video, the group will vote on which person's video they thought was the best. The person whose video gets the most votes gets a point.
        5Ô∏è‚É£ The first player to get 3 points wins the game. üèÜ

        Special Rules:
        Each player also has three "Superpowers" they can use once per game:
        - Reroll a single character: If you don't like one of the characters in your search term, you can reroll it to get a new random character.
        - Replace a character with a character of their choosing: If you have a specific character you want in your search term, you can replace one of the existing characters with it.
        - Swap two characters in the search term: If you think your search term would be better with two characters swapped, you can do that too!

        Use your superpowers wisely and have fun!
